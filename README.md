## ✨ The Candid Experience

### 🎲 Dice Roll
Sometimes, the best choice is the one left to fate. Input your options and let the 3D dice take over. Designed for quick, low-stakes decisions to keep your momentum going.

### ✊ RPS Duel (Rock Paper Scissors)
Settle it the classic way. A real-time, synchronized duel powered by **Supabase** where the winner earns the ultimate right to be the decider. Perfect for head-to-head "friendly" debates.

### ⚖️ The Verdict (AI Arbiter)
For when the debate gets serious. Multiple users submit their choices and justifications in a shared courtroom. **Google Gemini AI** acts as the Judge, weighing the arguments and delivering a witty, definitive verdict that lightens the mood while settling the score.
